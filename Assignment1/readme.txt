\f0\fs24 \cf0 There is a jupyter note book file named \'93A1.ipynb\'94 in \'93image_set\'94 folder which contains the answer for part 1 and part 2. You can run the notebook by running the jupyter notebook command and then going to the folder which contains the notebook.\
\
I\'92ve added an experiment section to see if I can improve my results but I could not get any better results.\
\
Also the results are available in results folder.\
There is a .py version of the code for testing but I was using jupyter notebook for coding.\
